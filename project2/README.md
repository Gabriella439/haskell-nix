# Native dependencies

Nix can also provision non-Haskell dependencies for your project.  This project
provides an example of a small program that invokes `libtar` to open and close
a TAR file.

The first difference is that we have to extend the `cabal` file to add an
`extra-libraries` clause:

```cabal
name: project2
version: 1.0.0
license: BSD3
license-file: LICENSE
cabal-version: >= 1.18
build-type: Simple
extra-source-files: cbits

executable project2
    build-depends: base < 5
    default-language: Haskell2010
    c-sources: cbits/check.c
    extra-libraries: tar
    main-is: Main.hs
```

We also use the `c-sources` line so that Cabal can build and link in a small
test C program located at `cbits/check.c` for demonstration purposes.  This
program uses `libtar` to open and close a tar file named `example.tar`:

```c
#include <libtar.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void check() {
	int ret;
	TAR *t;

	ret = tar_open(&t, "example.tar", NULL, O_RDONLY, 0, TAR_VERBOSE);
	if (ret == -1) {
		fprintf(stderr, "tar_open failed\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	printf("Successfully opened example.tar\n");

	ret = tar_close(t);
	if (ret == -1) {
		fprintf(stderr, "tar_close failed\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	printf("Successfully closed example.tar\n");
}
```

... and then we refer to the `check` function from the Haskell code like this:

```haskell
module Main where

foreign import ccall "check" check :: IO ()

main :: IO ()
main = check
```

Like before, we transform the `project2.cabal` file into a Nix expression by
running `cabal2nix`:

```bash
$ cabal2nix . > project2.nix
```

`cabal2nix` is smart and notices that our `project2.cabal` file has an
`extra-libraries` section and adds `tar` as a dependency of our package in
`project2.nix`:

```nix
{ mkDerivation, base, lib, tar }:
mkDerivation {
  pname = "project2";
  version = "1.0.0";
  src = ./.;
  isLibrary = false;
  isExecutable = true;
  executableHaskellDepends = [ base ];
  executableSystemDepends = [ tar ];
  license = lib.licenses.bsd3;
}
```

The `tar` dependency goes in the `executableSystemDepends` section, which
indicates that this is a dependency on a native library and not a Haskell
dependency.

However, this alone is not enough to thread `libtar` to our package.  We need
to update our `release.nix` to specify which Nix package the `tar` dependency
comes from:

```nix
let
  config = {
    packageOverrides = pkgs: rec {
      haskellPackages = pkgs.haskellPackages.override {
        overrides = haskellPackagesNew: haskellPackagesOld: rec {
          project2 =
            haskellPackagesNew.callPackage ./project2.nix {
              tar = pkgs.libtar;
            };
        };
      };
    };
  };

  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { inherit config; };

in
  rec {
    project2 = pkgs.haskellPackages.project2;

    test = pkgs.runCommand "check" {} ''
      touch example
      tar cf example.tar example
      ${project2}/bin/project2 | tee $out
    '';
  }
```

In fact, our `release.nix` file goes a step further and includes two attributes
instead of one:

* the `project2` attribute builds our project
* the `test` attribute runs a simple test to verify that the program works

If we only care about building the project, then we would just run:

```bash
$ nix-build --attr project2 release.nix
```

... but if we want to build and test our project, we can run:

```bash
$ nix-build --attr test release.nix
these derivations will be built:

/nix/store/zc7ai4h44fydbm89a85b5bik5683klyk-check
```

Notice how the `configureFlags` passed to `project2` ensure that Nix's `libtar`
is on `cabal`'s search path when building the library.  Then the tests are run
and the output is saved to `/nix/store/zc7ai4h44fydbm89a85b5bik5683klyk-check`,
which we can also reference via the `result` symlink that `nix-build` creates:

```bash
$ cat result 
Successfully opened example.tar
Successfully closed example.tar
```
